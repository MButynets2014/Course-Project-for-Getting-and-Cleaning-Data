This respository includes three files: R script ('run_analysis.R'), Code Book ('CodeBook.md') and Output Data Set ('averages_data.txt') for Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project. The R script covers all 5 steps conducted for the Course Project task. The Code Book describes variables used in the task. The Output Data Set (called 'averages_data.txt') is the tidy data set from the last step of the task.
#The R script works in the following way: 
1. Setting a working directory 2.Loading X_train, X_test data sets and a list of features 3.Merging train and test data sets 4.Extracting the data with mean amd std measuremets 5.Labeling the data with descriptive variable names 6.Loading and naming activities 7.Loading and naming subject data 8.Combining final data set to conduct the last step 9.Computing average of each variable for each activity and each subject 10.Creating a text file with output tidy data set
