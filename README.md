This respository includes three files: R script (run_analysis.R), Code Book and text file called "averages_data" for Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project. The R script covers all 5 steps conducted for the Course Project task. The Code Book describes variables used in the task. The file "averages_data" is the tidy data set for the last step.
The R script works in the following way:
#Setting a working directory
#Loading X_train, X_test data sets and a list of features
#Merging train and test data sets
#Extracting the data with mean amd std measuremets
#Labeling the data with descriptive variable names
#Loading and naming activities
#Loading and naming subject data
#Combining final data set to conduct the last step
#Computing average of each variable for each activity and each subject
#Creating a text file with output tidy data set
